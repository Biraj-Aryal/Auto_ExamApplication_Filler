# Auto_ExamApplication_Filler
GUI to fill personal info into, which gets properly inserted in relevant text boxes/check boxes/etc in a MS Word document, ready to be uploaded to college's website/email as a valid exam application form.

How to use:
1) Simply run main.py to get the GUI initiated. Then fill in the details, including two photo files uploads. Then, hit generate. 
2) Doing so will generate a DOCX file in the main directory.
3) Optional: If you wish to repeat the process, then make sure to rename/move the previously generated file so that there's space for another generation of file withh the same name. Otherwise, the generate button will not generate the DOCX file.
